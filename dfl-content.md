Hey! Thanks for checking me out! Here's a bit about DFL, details on ordering are further down.

##About

I've been sewing folks custom bags for about 3â€“4 years and growing kinda fast. Maybe a bit too fast, so instead of ramping up production to meet demand, I'm now just making it difficult to order (you have to order by mail.) BUT, I make most anything that sounds fun to make, generally related to cycling in some way (but also sometimes not). Most things I make are one-offs, so things take a while.

DFL has moved several times but is located in the vicinity of Carrboro, NC - currently sewing in a trailer/house in a field a few miles from town. Lemme know if you're bicycle touring through and I'll find a spot for ya!

I think that about covers it.

##Ordering A bag

Thanks! First move would be to check out some other stuff I've made (photos are at the bottom of this page) and see if that's some-what in line with what you want. Still in? Sweet!
Now just send me a letter with a description of what you want and your phone # (or return address), so I can call to work out details. Sketches are cool too.

Price is tricky, but I'm not trying to rip anyone off and am generally cheaper/comparable than alternatives. All the bags at the bottom of this page have prices so that should give some indication, before I give you a quote.

So here's my address:
Adam
Carrboro NC, 27510
