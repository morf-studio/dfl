      <p>I've been sewing folks custom bags for about 3â€“4 years and growing kinda fast. I make most anything that sounds fun to make, generally related to cycling in some way (but also sometimes not). Most things I make are one-offs, so things take a while.</p>
      <p>DFL has moved several times but is located in the vicinity of Carrboro, NC - currently sewing in a trailer/house in a field a few miles from town. Lemme know if you're bicycle touring through and I'll find a spot for ya!</p>
      <p>I think that about covers it.</p>

      <p>Thanks! First move would be to check out some other stuff I've made (photos are at the bottom of this page) and see if that's some-what in line with what you want. Still in? Sweet!
      Now just send me a letter with the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A description of what you want</li>
        <li>Your phone number (or return address)</li>
        <li>Sketches are cool too</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Price is tricky, but I'm not trying to rip anyone off and am generally cheaper/comparable than alternatives. All the bags at the bottom of this page have prices so that should give some indication, before I give you a quote.
      </p>

      <p>So here's my address:</p>

      <p><strong>Adam Balfour</strong><br>
         The Tiny Trailer House <br>
         3800 Arthur Minnis Rd. <br>
         Hillsboro NC, 27278
      </p>
